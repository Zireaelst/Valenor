# Sepolia Integration Tests

Comprehensive Hardhat test suite for the complete Valenor Decentralized Autonomous Social Fund workflow on Ethereum Sepolia testnet.

## 🌟 Test Coverage

### ✅ **Complete Workflow Test**
Tests the full end-to-end process:
1. **Deploy Contracts**: TestUSDC → FundContract → GovernanceContract
2. **Mint USDC**: Mint tokens to donors
3. **Approve Spending**: Approve FundContract to spend USDC
4. **Donate**: Donor donates to project
5. **Create Proposal**: Create proposal in GovernanceContract
6. **Vote**: Vote YES on proposal
7. **Advance Time**: Move past voting deadline
8. **Execute**: Execute proposal → recipient receives USDC

### ✅ **Multiple Donors Test**
Tests scenarios with multiple participants:
- Multiple donors donating to same project
- Multiple votes on same proposal
- Aggregated voting power calculation
- Successful execution with multiple donors

### ✅ **Negative Security Tests**

#### **Reentrancy Attack Prevention**
- Verifies `nonReentrant` modifier is present
- Tests multiple donations in succession
- Confirms reentrancy protection is active

#### **Non-Governance Fund Release Prevention**
- Attempts direct fund release bypassing governance
- Verifies only governance can release funds
- Confirms access control is working

#### **Insufficient Voting Power Prevention**
- Attempts proposal creation without donations
- Verifies minimum voting power requirement (1000 USDC)
- Confirms proposal creation is properly restricted

#### **Double Voting Prevention**
- Attempts to vote twice on same proposal
- Verifies one vote per address restriction
- Confirms voting integrity

#### **Early Execution Prevention**
- Attempts to execute proposal before deadline
- Verifies voting period enforcement
- Confirms time-based restrictions

#### **Failed Proposal Execution Prevention**
- Creates proposal that fails (NO votes > YES votes)
- Attempts to execute failed proposal
- Confirms only passed proposals can be executed

### ✅ **Contract State Verification**
Comprehensive state validation after operations:
- FundContract: Total donations, releases, project balances
- GovernanceContract: Proposal count, states, execution status
- USDC Token: Balances, transfers, approvals

## 📊 Test Results

### **Expected Output**
```
Sepolia Integration Tests
  Complete Workflow Test
    ✓ Should complete the full workflow: Deploy → Mint → Donate → Propose → Vote → Execute (212ms)
  Multiple Donors and Votes Test
    ✓ Should handle multiple donors and votes correctly (81ms)
  Negative Test: Reentrancy Attack
    ✓ Should prevent reentrancy attacks on FundContract
  Negative Test: Non-Governance Fund Release
    ✓ Should prevent non-governance from releasing funds (73ms)
  Negative Test: Insufficient Voting Power
    ✓ Should prevent proposal creation with insufficient voting power (40ms)
  Negative Test: Double Voting
    ✓ Should prevent double voting on proposals (57ms)
  Negative Test: Proposal Execution Before Deadline
    ✓ Should prevent proposal execution before deadline (70ms)
  Negative Test: Failed Proposal Execution
    ✓ Should prevent execution of failed proposals (69ms)
  Contract State Verification
    ✓ Should verify all contract states after operations (83ms)

9 passing (3s)

## 🔧 Test Architecture

### **Contract Deployment Order**
1. **TestUSDC**: ERC20 token for testing
2. **FundContract**: Manages donations and releases
3. **GovernanceContract**: Handles proposals and voting
4. **Integration**: Set governance in FundContract

### **Test Data**
- **Project ID**: 1
- **Donation Amount**: 5000 USDC
- **Proposal Amount**: 2000 USDC
- **Voting Period**: 7 days
- **Minimum Voting Power**: 1000 USDC

### **Test Accounts**
- **owner**: Contract deployer and owner
- **donor1**: Primary donor with voting power
- **donor2**: Secondary donor for multi-donor tests
- **recipient**: Receives funds from executed proposals
- **attacker**: Attempts malicious operations

## 🛡️ Security Validations

### **Access Control**
- ✅ Only governance can release funds
- ✅ Only donors with sufficient voting power can create proposals
- ✅ Only proposal creators and voters can interact with proposals

### **Input Validation**
- ✅ All function parameters are validated
- ✅ Zero addresses are rejected
- ✅ Invalid amounts are rejected
- ✅ Invalid project IDs are rejected

### **State Management**
- ✅ Proposal states are properly tracked
- ✅ Voting records are maintained
- ✅ Fund balances are accurately calculated
- ✅ Execution status is properly managed

### **Time-based Controls**
- ✅ Voting period enforcement
- ✅ Proposal deadline validation
- ✅ Execution timing restrictions

## 📝 Test Scenarios

### **Positive Scenarios**
1. **Single Donor Workflow**: Complete process with one donor
2. **Multiple Donors**: Multiple participants in same project
3. **State Verification**: All contract states after operations

### **Negative Scenarios**
1. **Reentrancy Attack**: Attempt to exploit reentrancy vulnerability
2. **Unauthorized Access**: Attempt to bypass access controls
3. **Insufficient Permissions**: Attempt operations without required permissions
4. **Invalid Operations**: Attempt operations that should fail
5. **Timing Attacks**: Attempt operations at wrong times

## 🔍 Debugging

### **Common Issues**

#### **Test Failures**
```bash
# Check contract compilation
npm run compile

# Run individual contract tests
npx hardhat test test/TestUSDC.test.js
npx hardhat test test/FundContract.test.js
npx hardhat test test/GovernanceContract.test.js
```

#### **Gas Issues**
```bash
# Check gas estimates
npm run estimate:gas
```

#### **Network Issues**
```bash
# Check balance
npm run check:balance
```

### **Test Debugging**
```javascript
// Add console.log statements in tests
console.log("Debug info:", await contract.getSomeValue());

// Use hardhat console for debugging
npx hardhat console
> const contract = await ethers.getContractAt("ContractName", "0x...")
> await contract.someFunction()
```
